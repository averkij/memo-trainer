# Memory trainer tool

- Want to memorize 100-digit numbers?
- Wonder how to remember the whole playing card deck's order?
- Or maybe you just want to improve you memory or amaze your friends?

This method based on the book "Quantum Memory Power" by Dominic O'Brien with my adaptation to the Russian language.
I'm recommending you to read this book, but briefly here it are the major points:

1. Translate the digits to the letters (I'm using Cyrillic alphabet since my native language is Russian) and strongly memorize them.

	0 - О (shape similarity)
	1 - А (the first letter of the alphabet)
	2 - Д ("Два")
	3 - Т ("Три")
	4 - Ч ("Четыре")
	5 - П ("Пять")
	6 - Е (the sixth letter of the alphabet)
	7 - С ("Семь")
	8 - В ("Восемь")
	9 - Р ("shape similarity")

2. Translate the numbers from 0 to 99 into letters and map them to the persons you know perfectly (celebrity or friend of yours) and can recall them by this two letter no matter what. It's well known that the human brain is good in remembering persons.

	Examples:
	
	- The most simple way is to use the name and surname letters:
	
	15 - AП - Александр Пушкин
	44 - ЧЧ - Чарли Чаплин
	55 - ПП - Пабло Пикассо
	66 - ЕЕ - Евгений Евстигнеев
	89 - ВР - Вильгельм Ренгтен
	91 - РА - Роман Абрамович
	
	- or use any other association because it can be hard to find the right name:
	
	01 - Юрий Гагарин (the first human in space)
	07 - Джеймс Бонд (007 agent)
	09 - Роналдо (football player with 9-th number)
	
	etc.
	
3. The memory palace. Now you need to order your people. To do that imagine the path with the stops that you follow daily or know so good that you just can't ever forget. The amount of stops is up to you, I have 52 stops in my palace to memo the card's deck.

	Examples:
	
	0 - Your bedroom
	1 - The kitchen
	2 - The elevator
	3 - The entrance to your house
	4 - The subway station
	
	...
	
	52 - Your work place
	
	It can be anything, the point is that you must be able to recall it.
	
4. When memorizing the long number split it to 2 digit chunks and one by one imagine the person and place it to the each stop in your memory palace. After some training you will be able memorize realy long numbers quickly!

5. I'm using this tool to train the 2nd abd 3rd points. By now it's my data hardcoded, the tool should be able to read the data from the external source (text file). It will be done someday.
